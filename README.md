# C13-Ballon-buster
Meera has visited her grandparents. Her grandparents took her to a carnival, where she played the game of bursting balloons with a bow and an arrow. Meera loved this game a lot! When she came back home, she decided to build a computer game similar to the actual balloon bursting game. Can you help Meera design the game?
